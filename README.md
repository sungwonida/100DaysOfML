## Objective

The objective of this project is to dedicate myself 1 hour to study machine learning everyday for 100 days.  

### Reminiscence 

This has ended up with failure due to my personal schedule (I'm making an excuse).  
But I endeavor to get myself almost everyday to be proficient to the fundamentals of ML along with to state-of-the-art ML & AI technologies by tinkering with the toy projects in the communities and subscribing the newsletters.
