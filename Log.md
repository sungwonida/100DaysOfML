# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : Jul 6 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I'm still struggling to get equipped myself with things to train the network including backprop and gradient descent to give a natural presentation to my team members on the seminar early next week.  
Here are what I've gone through so far
* [Machine Learning Week 5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/5)
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning Week 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/week/2)
* [CS231n Lecture 3 - Loss Functions and Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7iBpEHGVNc&index=3&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)
* [CS231n Lecture 4 - Introduction to Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d14TUNcbn1k&index=4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)
* [CS231n Lecture 6 - Training Neural Networks I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEoyxE0GP2M&index=6&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)
* [Yes you should understand backprop](https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b)

**Thoughts** : Copying the whole lecture video to my brain and just speak that as is may the best method. (if I could)
