# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : Jul 6, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I'm still struggling to get equipped myself with things to train the network including backprop and gradient descent to give a natural presentation to my team members on the seminar early next week.  
Here are what I've gone through so far

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning Week 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/week/2)
* [CS231n Lecture 3 - Loss Functions and Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7iBpEHGVNc&index=3&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)

**Thoughts** : Copying whole words in lecture video to my brain and just speak that as is may the best method. (if I could)

## Day 1 : Jul 7, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I didn't do much today. Shopping with my wife and son, I planned to do some exercises to make the NN concepts concrete in my head. Took some ML lectures from YouTube. Also, took some RL videos to have more "[Integrative Complexity](https://medium.com/the-mission/studies-show-that-people-who-have-high-integrative-complexity-are-more-likely-to-be-successful-443480e8930c)".

**Thoughts** : CS231n assignments would be great.

## Day 2 : Jul 8, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Coded some graph architecture in Python with Pythonista(iOS App), and took some relative lectures from YouTube.

**Thoughts** : The way Andrej, Justin, and Serena take to explain the backprop is really intuitive and great.

## Day 3 : Jul 9, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Tried tf-openpose with team members, and had conversation about it. 

**Thoughts** : It looks pretty promising. But when it comes to further investments, I have to first learn way playing around it with no hurdles. Such as I/O parts of the framework.

## Day 4 : Jul 10, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Had my own seminar on Machine Learning Fundamental for the team members.

**Thoughts** : That was the 3rd series on Machine Learning seminar. (1. Deep Learning for Computer Vision, 2. Machine Learning Fundamental, 3. Machine Learning Fundamental (cont.)). I think these series are enough for the team members in elevating their mind to this field. The missing parts might be discovered by the team members themselves.

I couldn't cite the sites, the lecture, and the papers enough, so please let me know if there's any possible problem. I'll make a change on that.

## Day 5 : Jul 11, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Took some RL lectures

**Thoughts** : Just had an overview. I feel I should dig into those soon.
