# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : Jul 6, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I'm still struggling to get equipped myself with things to train the network including backprop and gradient descent to give a natural presentation to my team members on the seminar early next week.  
Here are what I've gone through so far

**Thoughts** : Copying whole words in lecture video to my brain and just speak that as is may the best method. (if I could)

## Day 1 : Jul 7, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I didn't do much today. Shopping with my wife and son, I planned to do some exercises to make the NN concepts concrete in my head. Took some ML lectures from YouTube. Also, took some RL videos to have more "[Integrative Complexity](https://medium.com/the-mission/studies-show-that-people-who-have-high-integrative-complexity-are-more-likely-to-be-successful-443480e8930c)".

**Thoughts** : CS231n assignments would be great.

## Day 2 : Jul 8, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Coded some graph architecture in Python with Pythonista(iOS App), and took some relative lectures from YouTube.

**Thoughts** : The way Andrej, Justin, and Serena take to explain the backprop is really intuitive and great.

## Day 3 : Jul 9, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Tried tf-openpose with team members, and had conversation about it. 

**Thoughts** : It looks pretty promising. But when it comes to further investments, I have to first learn way playing around it with no hurdles. Such as I/O parts of the framework.
